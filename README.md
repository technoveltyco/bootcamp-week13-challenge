## Overview

### The challenge

Create the initial scaffolding for your first portfolio site, as well as create or update other materials so that you can showcase your skills to potential employers. Creating a portfolio using React will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios do not use some of the latest technologies.

## My process

First, I started designing the content architecture of the different sections, content and how they will link each other on the website.

### Content Architecture

On the mindmap above, I separate the content in purple, for those sections that I would deliver for this challenge, and in gray those that need work and are for future project development.
